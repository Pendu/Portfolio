My research journey spans from fundamental machine learning optimization to cutting-edge industrial applications. At the Master's level, I developed novel algorithms for large-scale Support Vector Machines, creating the ACF-BDCA method that achieved 30% speedup over industry standards while maintaining accuracy. My PhD work represents a significant evolution, focusing on end-to-end deep reinforcement learning solutions for complex industrial control systems. This research addresses real-world challenges in resource allocation, safety constraints, and stochastic dynamicsâ€”culminating in the creation of ContainerGym, an open-source benchmark for industrial AI. Throughout both projects, I've maintained a strong emphasis on practical implementation, from C++ optimization libraries to PyTorch-based reinforcement learning frameworks, always bridging the gap between theoretical advances and real-world deployment.
