Book Reviews
============

.. I am a voracious reader. I read books on philosophy, psychology, history, and economics. In my free time, I love to watch videos from 3Blue1Brown, Veritasium, Vsauce, MythBusters, etc. - you get the idea. 

.. I was inspired by this `nytimes article <https://archive.is/20250727045733/https://www.nytimes.com/2025/07/26/books/man-died-book-list-thousands.html>`_ [man reads 3599 books in his lifetime] and wanted to create a section that is a curated collection of my reading journey with quick short reviews.


.. This section serves as a curated collection of book reviews and references:

.. * **Technical books:** A reference guide to quality books organized by topic that i have read/am reading and are my go to references.
.. * **Non-technical books:** Brief reviews capturing key lessons and insights for personal reference

This section serves as a curated collection of ML books that i have read/am reading and are my go to references.
