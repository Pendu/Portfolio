**PhD Researcher** | Ruhr University Bochum
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Research Focus:**
Designed an end-to-end deep reinforcement learning (RL) solution to solve a complex resource allocation bottleneck for a real-world industrial control system. My approach features a Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) agent trained via a sophisticated curriculum learning strategy to handle sparse rewards and conflicting business objectives like throughput and safety.

**Key Contributions:**
- Developed a hybrid system combining RL with predictive modeling for operational safety and efficiency
- Integrated a low-latency, inference-time planning module using XGBoost models trained on Monte Carlo simulation data
- Contributed to 'ContainerGym,' a reusable, open-source benchmark to accelerate the development of ML solutions for industrial AI
- Implemented proactive resource contention management to prevent costly system failures

**Technical Skills:** PyTorch, Weights & Biases, Deep Reinforcement Learning, Curriculum Learning, Monte Carlo Simulation, XGBoost, Industrial AI
