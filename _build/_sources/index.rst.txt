Research & Publications
******************************************

My research focuses on developing robust and scalable machine learning solutions for complex industrial control problems. A primary area of my work has been applying advanced reinforcement learning (RL) techniques, such as curriculum learning and hybrid RL-planning architectures, to optimize resource allocation in real-world, high-throughput systems with stochastic dynamics and strict safety constraints.

    **Curriculum RL meets Monte Carlo Planning: Optimization of a Real World Container Management Problem**
    
    `A. Pendyala and T. Glasmachers, European conference for Machine Learning (ECML), 2025 (to appear) <https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17194>`_
    
    This paper introduces a hybrid RL-planning method that uses a curriculum-learning trained agent and an offline-trained collision model to proactively avert safety-limit violations in a waste-sorting facility. The work provides actionable guidelines for designing safer and more efficient industrial systems.

    **Solving a Real-World Optimization Problem Using Proximal Policy Optimization with Curriculum Learning and Reward Engineering**
    
    `A. Pendyala, A. Atamna, and T. Glasmachers, European conference for Machine Learning (ECML), 2024 <https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02577>`_
    
    We demonstrate a five-stage curriculum learning approach combined with meticulous reward engineering to train a PPO agent for a complex industrial control task. The method enables the agent to effectively balance competing objectives of operational safety, volume optimization, and resource usage, where a vanilla agent fails.

    **ContainerGym: A Real-World Reinforcement Learning Benchmark for Resource Allocation**
    
    `A. Pendyala, J. Dettmer, T. Glasmachers, and A. Atamna, International Conference on Machine Learning, Optimization, and Data Science (LOD), 2023 <https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.02991>`_
    
    This work introduces ContainerGym, an open-source RL benchmark environment derived directly from a real-world industrial resource allocation problem. It is designed to evaluate and highlight the limitations of state-of-the-art RL algorithms on challenges such as delayed rewards, stochastic dynamics, and resource scarcity.

    **Online Budgeted Stochastic Coordinate Ascent for Large-Scale Kernelized Dual Support Vector Machine Training**
    
    `S. Qaadan, A. Pendyala, M. SchÃ¼ler, and T. Glasmachers, International Conference on Pattern Recognition Applications and Methods (ICPRAM), 2020 <https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-030-41014-2_14>`_
    
    This paper presents a novel C++ algorithm that combines an adaptive coordinate frequency optimization with a budget maintenance strategy to accelerate the training of non-linear Support Vector Machines (SVMs) on large-scale datasets.

PhD Thesis
************

* **Title:** Optimizing Industrial Process through Reinforcement Learning
* **Supervisor:** Prof. Dr. Tobias Glasmachers
* **Abstract:**
  Optimizing complex industrial processes, particularly those involving resource allocation under uncertainty and strict constraints, presents significant challenges for traditional control methods. This thesis addresses the optimization of container management in a real-world, high-throughput waste sorting facility, a critical stage impacting overall efficiency and sustainability. The core task involves scheduling the emptying of multiple containers, which accumulate different materials at stochastic rates, into a limited number of shared processing units (PUs). This research proposes a progressively sophisticated set of techniques centered around Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO), including a multi-stage curriculum learning strategy and a novel hybrid RL-planning architecture that augments the agent with an offline-trained collision model. The findings demonstrate the potential of combining structured learning techniques with domain-specific models to develop safe, efficient, and scalable control solutions for challenging industrial applications.
