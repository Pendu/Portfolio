   :alt: Abhijeet Pendyala, PhD Researcher and ML Engineer

I am a **Machine Learning Engineer and PhD researcher** specializing in **Industrial AI** and **Deep Reinforcement Learning**. With over 7 years of experience, my expertise lies in designing and deploying scalable, production-grade ML systems that solve complex, real-world problems. I bridge the gap between academic theory and practical engineering, translating cutting-edge research into robust software solutions.

**Featured Projects & Publications**
===================================

**EcoKI ML Platform**
My work as a software developer for the EcoKI project focused on designing core architectural frameworks for a low-code ML platform. I was responsible for:
* Developing a **microservices architecture** and modular **BuildingBlock** and **Pipeline** systems.
* Engineering and implementing end-to-end ML workflows, from data preprocessing to time-series forecasting.
* Standardizing engineering practices, including **automated testing protocols** and **Sphinx-based technical documentation**.

**Computer Vision & Perception**
I have extensive experience developing machine learning solutions for computer vision and autonomous systems. Key projects include:
* **Autonomous Driving (Kopernikus Automotive):** Developed and optimized perception models for object detection and localization (RetinaNet, YOLO) for autonomous vehicles. Implemented model compression techniques with TensorRT for deployment on edge devices.
* **Fish Recognition App (Freelance):** Designed an app to identify fish species, predict length, and detect key points (mouth, tail) using PyTorch and Keras image regression models. This involved extensive work on data augmentation and synthetic dataset generation.
