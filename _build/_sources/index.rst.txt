I am a machine learning engineer with a passion for building scalable and efficient machine learning models. 

I am a voracoius reader. I read books of philosophy, psychology, history, economics. In my free time i love to watch  videos from 3blue1brown, veritasium, vsauce, mythbusters etc, you get the idea. 

I like mindmaps, survey papers,

This website acts as a detailed curriculum vitae, a quick peek into my interests and a place to share my machine learning blog posts.
