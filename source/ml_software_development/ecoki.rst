EcoKI: Machine Learning Software Development
============================================

As a lead contributor to the **EcoKI project**, a low-code machine learning platform, I was responsible for designing and deploying end-to-end AI solutions for industrial applications. My work focused on establishing a modular and scalable architecture, developing a robust library of reusable ML components, and implementing modern MLOps and quality standards.

*********************************************
Designing a Modular & Scalable Architecture
*********************************************

**The Challenge:**

The platform needed to be highly adaptable for a wide range of industrial use cases, which required a modular and extensible architecture. The core problem was to enable different data processing, modeling, and visualization components to be easily connected and reused without creating tight dependencies.

**My Solution:**

I played a key role in designing and implementing the platform's core architectural frameworks, establishing a **microservices architecture** and pioneering the foundational **BuildingBlock** and **Pipeline** systems.

* **BuildingBlock Framework:** I defined and implemented the concept of a `BuildingBlock` as a self-contained Python class with a singular purpose (e.g., data imputation, model training). This framework included standardized ports for inputs and outputs, ensuring seamless data compatibility and interchangeability across all components.
* **Pipeline Framework:** I designed the `Pipeline` framework to serve as a directed acyclic graph (DAG) of `BuildingBlocks`. This allowed application engineers to construct complex, end-to-end ML workflows by simply configuring connections, which could be visually managed through a drag-and-drop interface.

This architectural foundation was critical for enabling the platform's flexibility, reusability, and long-term scalability.

Developing End-to-End ML Solutions
*********************************************

**The Challenge:**

The platform required a robust library of ML components to cover the entire machine learning lifecycle, from data ingestion to advanced modeling. These components needed to be generic enough for diverse industrial applications yet powerful enough to deliver accurate and meaningful results.

**My Solution:**

I engineered and developed several key **ML building blocks** and **pipelines**, ensuring they were production-ready and adhered to architectural standards.

* **Data Integration & Preprocessing:** I created blocks for data reading (e.g., from MongoDB, CSV), handling missing values (`DataImputer`), time-series resampling, and feature selection (`Recursive Feature Elimination`).
* **Classical & Deep Learning Models:** I developed `BuildingBlocks` for common regression models, including **XGBoost** and **Linear Regression**, and implemented a multi-output regressor for complex tasks. I also contributed a time-series forecasting block using **LSTM** neural networks.
* **Optimization & Visualization:** I developed components for black-box optimization (`ProcessParameterOptimizer`) and built interactive dashboards using the `Panel` library to visualize data, monitor energy consumption, and display model predictions in real-time.

These contributions formed the core of the platform's initial offering, enabling proof-of-concept projects that demonstrated the platform's value to our partners.

*********************************************
Implementing MLOps & Quality Standards
*********************************************

**The Challenge:**

As a lead contributor, I identified the need for robust software engineering practices to ensure the platform's quality, reproducibility, and long-term maintainability. This was essential for transitioning a research prototype into a production-grade product.

**My Solution:**

I established and standardized several key MLOps and quality assurance protocols across the project.

* **Testing Protocols:** I designed and implemented the first comprehensive **testing protocols for pipelines and building blocks**. This included creating a clear workflow for validating functionality and ensuring the system's robustness across different operating systems (Windows, Linux, macOS).
* **Documentation:** I championed the adoption of a standardized technical documentation process using **Sphinx**, ensuring all code was consistently documented. This significantly improved the platform's accessibility for new developers and application engineers.
* **Packaging & CI/CD:** I was responsible for the packaging of the platform as a `pip`-installable library using **Poetry**. I also contributed to the design and implementation of the containerization strategy with `Docker` and `Kubernetes`, which simplified deployment for both development and production environments.

These efforts were instrumental in ensuring the project's long-term viability and its readiness for commercialization.

*********************************************
Leadership & Project Management
*********************************************

In addition to my technical contributions, I took on several leadership responsibilities to drive project execution and foster a collaborative environment.

* **Requirements Gathering:** I led **user story mapping** and **requirements collection** workshops with partner companies, effectively translating business needs into actionable technical specifications for the development team.
* **Agile Practices:** I regularly facilitated **sprint reviews** and **retrospective meetings**, fostering a culture of continuous improvement and ensuring the team remained aligned on project goals.
* **Process Improvement:** I developed an automated script to generate a centralized overview of all `BuildingBlocks` and `Pipelines`. This tool enabled the team to identify and eliminate redundant components, leading to a significant **streamlining of the development process** and a more organized codebase.
