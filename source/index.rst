Featured Experience & Publications
================================

PhD Research: Industrial AI & Reinforcement Learning
----------------------------------------------------
My doctoral research focused on developing end-to-end deep reinforcement learning solutions for a complex industrial control system. I designed a hybrid approach that combined a Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) agent with a novel curriculum learning strategy and an offline-trained predictive model to manage resource allocation, enhance operational safety, and prevent system failures.

ML Software Engineering: EcoKI Platform
---------------------------------------
My work on the EcoKI project focused on designing core architectural frameworks for a low-code ML platform. I was responsible for:

* Developing a **microservices architecture** and modular **BuildingBlock** and **Pipeline** systems.
* Engineering and implementing end-to-end ML workflows, from data preprocessing to time-series forecasting.
* Standardizing engineering practices, including **automated testing protocols** and **Sphinx-based technical documentation**.

Computer Vision & Perception Projects
------------------------------------
I have extensive experience developing machine learning solutions for computer vision and autonomous systems. Key experiences include:

* **Autonomous Driving (Kopernikus Automotive):** Developed and optimized perception models for object detection and localization (RetinaNet, YOLO) for autonomous vehicles. Implemented model compression techniques with TensorRT for deployment on edge devices.
* **Fish Recognition App (Freelance):** Helped to develop an app to identify fish species, predict length, and detect key points (mouth, tail) using PyTorch and Keras image regression models. This involved extensive work on data augmentation and synthetic dataset generation.
